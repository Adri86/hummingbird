## Contributing
The backend is a JSON API server built with Rails, Postgres, ElasticSearch, and Redis. The frontend is a client-side application written using Ember.

To get started, clone this repository, install Docker (via Docker for Mac/Windows or Docker-Machine if you're not on Linux) and run `bin/setup` to get a development version running. The script will automatically clone the client and server repository and perform the whole setup for you. Before you start working be sure to read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/hummingbird-me/hummingbird/blob/the-future/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To get data into your development server:

1. Download [our media database dump](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui1xaialiq67bnu/anime.sql.gz?dl=0)
2. Import the dump to your database:
   
   ```
   gzcat anime.sql.gz | bin/psql hummingbird_development
   ```
3. Set up Elasticsearch:

   ```
   bin/rake chewy:reset`
   ```
