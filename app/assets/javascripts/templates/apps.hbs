              This is a really cool application that has been around for quite a while.
              It does not actually do anything but it has a picture of a kitten in the 
              header so it has to be pretty awesome, right? Though, the picture resolution
              sucks, it's a pretty neat app. Also, its description is clearly a work of
              art, so you should definitely download it. (Run tehkitten.exe)
