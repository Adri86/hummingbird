Pull Requests
-------------

We love pull requests! We are very happy to work with you to get your changes merged in, however please keep the following in mind.

* Adhere to the coding conventions you see in the surrounding code.
* Include tests, and make sure all tests pass.
* Before submitting a pull-request, clean up the history by going over your commits and squashing together minor changes and fixes into the corresponding commits. You can do this using the interactive rebase command.

Security
--------

Please do not publish security vulnerabilities before giving us a chance to fix them. All security issues should be reported to <mailto:josh@hummingbird.me> directly. If you are not sure whether or not something is a security issue it is better to err on the side of caution and contact <mailto:josh@hummingbird.me> first.
